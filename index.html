                <p>
                    I am a medical device design verification Engineer with a background in Mechanical and Biomedical
                    Engineering. I like to
                    describe myself as the bridge between science and arts, because I am just as much an artist as I am
                    a
                    scientist. My interests vary from time to time, but currently, I'm hung up on Software as Medical
                    Devices
                    (SAMDs), theology and medical
                    TV dramas. I love to sing, in fact, I'd say I'm pretty good at it. I also love to read and write
                    poetry. If
                    you had followed me on Twitter between 2016 and 2020, you'd have seen some of my poetry. I know at
                    this
                    point you may be wondering,
                    "who exactly is Dorothy? Is she a biomechanical engineer, a design verification engineer, or a poet?
                    Well,
                    there's just one answer to that question - she is everything. Dorothy is the one that does it all.

                <h3 style="color: #2F4F4F;">Why Alt School?</h3>
                <p>
                    While working as a medical device design verification engineer, I have built proficiency in hardware
                    testing. However, seeing as
                    most modern medical devices are controlled by software, I realised that there was a gap in my
                    knowledge. In
                    order to effectively develop and verify medical devices, I have to understand and be able to develop
                    the
                    software that controls them.
                    Now I am not new to the world of online courses. However, after trying and failing several times at
                    going the self-taught route, I realised that I needed to give structure to my learning process. This
                    lead to
                </p>
                <h3 style="color: #2F4F4F;">My Goals for the Next Year with AltSchool</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand the fundamentals of software development</li>
                    <li>Learn how to solve problems with the computing skills I hope to build during the course of this
                        program
                    </li>
                    <li>Lay the building blocks for eventually developing Software as Medical Devices (SAMDs)</li>
                    <li>Build competency in object oriented programming (Python)</li>
                    <li>Collaborate with other engineers on projects and solutions</li>
                </ul>
